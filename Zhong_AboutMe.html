            <p>Hi, I'm Daniel Zhong. Currently, I am a junior attending Dublin High School. My personal goal is to be admitted to UCLA or UC Berkeley, and be a successful computer engineer. To achieve this goal, I need not only participate more actively and get a better grade but also mentally keep confident and have positive thinking. There are many reasons why I want to be a computer engineer. First of all, my father is a computer engineer, and it goes without saying that his career has influenced me. In addition, as technology became more and more advance in the modern society, it provides more safety, convenience, and useful tools in our lives. I want to help the society using the technology and computer skills.</p>
            <p>During Freshman year, I moved from Mission San Jose High School to Dublin High School, I played piano at that time and earned Royal Schools of Music Piano level 5. In addition, I had opportunities to learn and build up the website for the church. From then on I decided on a computer science major. Sophomore year, I took a Project Lead The Way (PLTW) Principles of Engineering Course. I was able to experiment with creating a variety of robots and mechanisms and learned to program in basic C.  In addition, I learned to code Netlogo simulations. I joined a lot of amazing club and sports team this year such as National Scholastic Honor Society (NSHSS), California Scholastic Federation (CSF), Math Club, Chinese Club, Key Club, Cross Country and Track and Field. I am the secretary of my school's Chinese Club. I also won East Bay Athletic League (EBAL) championship of Cross Country. Even though I didn't join DHS Gael Force robotic club, I helped my friend to build up the machine and learned a lot engineering principle. This year, which is the junior year, I'm taking computer science and videogame design, and I'm learning a lot of programming languages (Java, Java scripts, C++, HTML, CSS, Python, command line) and software (app inventor, Maya, Adobe Photoshop). The Engineer Academy provided me plenty of opportunities: field trip, guest speaker, mentor program, internship. Those activities not only enrich my experience but also allow me to meet different successful people. I also learned phpstudy and bootstrap outside of school. I took computer science courses at Las Positas College and online. Next year, I will take AP Physic and AP Computer Science in order to develop my engineer skills.</p>
            <p>When I'm off school academics, I like to play basketball, piano and socialize. I am always busy because my Asian parents like to put me in the tutoring center. Not only that, I usually take Dublin Partners In Education
| classes and some summer program to gain more knowledge. </p>
            <p>My best qualities are curiousity, focus, and work hard. I feel the need to know the reasoning behind everything, so I am the annoying kid that always ask a lot of questions. I often explore and desire the principle and ideas instead of just listen to the teacher. I'm pretty sure no one can be perfect. Albert Einstein said: â€œGenius is 1% talent and 99% percent hard work". So I am never late and absent without reason, never turn in homework late, and am never lazy. I remember when I took POE, I got D at first. I felt uncomfortable and started to pay attention and get  serious, I did all the extra credit and spent at least 2 hours each day to check my project and homework. Finally, I got a really good grade. Moreover, I am afraid to see people disappointed in me. I try my best to make everyone satisfied, especially my parents and teachers.</p>
